# Portfolio projects

In this repository, I will gather the code of some projects applied to disclosed data.

## Urban accessibility in R 
*(accessibility_R folder)*

Most of my research uses the urban accessibility indicator (number of reachable opportunities from a given point). Although I often processed it using the `tidyverse` libraries, I wondered if other libraries or methods are more efficient. Also, this project contains a basic opening and cleaning excel file script and a distance matrix calculation from a shapefile.
